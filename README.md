## _Motivation & Overview_

I have been a math instructor/interventionist in Nashville public and charter schools for the past 14 years. I have always been interested in school data because it gives critical insights into the educational system, helping to identify trends, measure performance, and inform decision-making. 

My project delves into the diverse demographics and socioeconomic issues effecting student performance, with a particular focus on state test scores in Tennessee. It examines various community types, such as urban, suburban, and rural areas, to understand their impact on educational outcomes. Additionally, the project assesses the readiness of students to graduate and tracks student growth over time, providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing educational achievement.
